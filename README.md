# Pong Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Pong game, developed using the Turtle graphics library.

## Overview

Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games, simulating table tennis. This project recreates the classic gameplay experience, allowing two players to control paddles and compete to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay:** Control paddles using keyboard inputs for a competitive experience.
- **Score Tracking:** Displays the current score for both players.
- **Classic Mechanics:** Faithful to the original Pong game dynamics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **Turtle Graphics Library:** Used for rendering game graphics.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure Python is installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanuel496/pong-game.git
   cd pong-game
   ```

2. **Run the Game:**

   Execute the main game script using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The game window should launch, allowing you to start playing immediately.

## How to Play

- **Player Controls:**
  - **Left Paddle:** Use the 'W' key to move up and the 'S' key to move down.
  - **Right Paddle:** Use the 'Up Arrow' key to move up and the 'Down Arrow' key to move down.

- **Objective:** Hit the ball with your paddle to send it towards your opponent. Score a point when the ball passes the opponent's paddle. The first player to reach a predetermined score wins the game.
